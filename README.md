# raven_absolute_controller
This software allows to control the Raven II robot (Applied Dexterity) in absolute positions.
You will need to have boost and eigen libraries to use this code.
The code needs to be embedded into the windows code of the Omni_client.
The Hello World file gives an example of how to use the absolute controller.

Doxygen documentation soon to come...
